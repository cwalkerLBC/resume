    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>At the City of Long Beach, my focus is on innovating through low-code platforms, with a specialization in Microsoft Power Platform administration. My responsibilities include managing diverse projects that streamline processes across departments, such as automating grant writing requests and developing a leave calendar system, all underscored by my commitment to enhancing city operations through technology. Co-leading a team that includes an administrative intern and a contract developer, we've successfully implemented solutions that have improved departmental efficiencies and service delivery. My expertise is not just in the technical realms of Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Bi, but also in empowering my team to deliver impactful solutions that address real-world challenges in our community.
